# Modern APOD Web

Modern web to explore [NASA's APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov) archive.

To fetch the data from NASA's APOD website it uses [Paweł Pleskaczyński's APOD API](https://github.com/PawelPleskaczynski/apod_api).

With this project I have practiced with JavaScript Promises, the Fetch API and MVC.

Current version live in https://trucosuso.github.io/APODWeb/

## Things to improve

- Open the modal only when the data has been fetch. Meanwhile show a loading animation in the button.
- Random images.
- Option to clear all images from view.
- Load APOD images chronologically when website loads.
- Embed videos in modal when needed.
- Better use of Bootstrap.
